  <p>Recently I have taken to writing notes for talks that I give and/or topics I am learning about. I do my 
  best to include references and make them as clear as possible for my future self, should I need to go back to them.
  Hopefully they can help other people as well!</p>

      <em>Brown Representability</em> (<a href="https://github.com/NicoCourts/Brown-Representability/raw/master/Brown-Representability.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NicoCourts/Brown-Representability">github</a>)
      <p>Notes for a talk I gave to my homological algebra course that built up to the results in Amnon Neeman's <em><a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/1996-9-01/S0894-0347-96-00174-9/home.html">The Grothendieck Duality Theorem via Bousfield's Techniques and Brown Representability</a></em>.
      Along the way we develop the notion of triangulated categories and of Brown Representability in its original context of (stable) homotopy theory. Eventually we show how Neeman recreated 
      Brown's original argument in the language of triangulated categories to establish important results regarding representability and adjointness of certain classes of functors.</p>

      <em>Notes on the Grassmannian</em> (<a href="https://github.com/NicoCourts/Grassmannian-Notes/raw/master/Grassmanian.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NicoCourts/Grassmannian-Notes">github</a>)
      <!--<p>I was asked to participate in a reading group on the Grassmannian. My role was to describe the construction via smooth 
        manifold theory of the Grassmannian as a quotient of \(GL(n)\). After motivating how we endow this set with a topology and smooth structure, I finish the 
        discussion with a quick argument that this manifold is compact.
      </p>
      <p>Along the way, I discovered that there had been a significant amount of work into recovering this classical geometric objects in the world of noncommutative algebraic geometry.
        Thus I dedicated the second half of my research to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002186939190214S">a paper</a> of Taft and Towber in which they 
        use the natural action of \(GL(n)\) on \(\operatorname{{'{'}}Gr}(k,n)\) and the quantized \(GL_q(n)\) to construct a comodule which plays the role of a \(q\)-analog of \(\operatorname{{'{'}}Gr}(k,n)\).

      <em>The Schur-Weyl Functor</em> (<a href="https://github.com/NicoCourts/Schur-Weyl-Functor/raw/master/SW-Functor.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NicoCourts/Schur-Weyl-Functor">github</a>)
    
    <!--<p>These are the notes for my summer project 2019. I am beginning with the work of Schur (beginning with his 1901 thesis) on polynomial representations of \(\Gamma_k=GL_n(k)\). This begins with his realization 
      that any polynomial representation affords a decomposition into indecomposables such that each summand is an \(A_k(n,r)\)-rational representation (that is, "homogeneous degree \(r\)") of \(k\Gamma_k\). Leveraging
      the equivalence of several (co)module categories, the representation theory is reduced to understanding representations of the (finite-dimensional!)
      algebra \(S_k(n,r)\), the Schur algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      After developing this classical story, I move on to understand how the Schur-Weyl functor between polynomial representations of \(GL_n\) and representations of \(\mathfrak{{'{'}}S}_r\)
      are related <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/compositio-mathematica/article/koszul-ringel-and-serre-duality-for-strict-polynomial-functors/4E5ABA82E2189C76274C2093DC63A604">strict polynomial functors</a> and to establish that the Schur-Weyl functor is monoidal under the tensor structure developed by Krause et al.
