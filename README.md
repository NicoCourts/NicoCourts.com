# Repo no longer managed
I have reimplemented my website using Jekyll and hosted it on github pages to make my life easier. You can view the new website [here](https://github.com/NicoCourts/jekyll-website).

## Nicocourts.com Website Frontend
This is the frontend for my website, created with Node and AngularJS. It interacts with the backend that you can find in another one of my repos. :)
