## Nicocourts.com Website Frontend
![travis-ci status](https://travis-ci.com/NicoCourts/NicoCourts.com.svg?branch=Live)

This is the frontend for my website, created with Angularjs. I used rather simple pieces for almost everything and will be writing a server to handle the blog at a later date.

I have made several updates but there are still more things to do.
